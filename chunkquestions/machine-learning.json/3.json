Small number of matchings does not necessarily implies that the model overfits, especially given 500 (!) independent variables. To me, it sounds more reasonable that the threshold (matching) criterion might be too tight, thus allowing only a small number of matching to occur. So a solution can be either softening the threshold criterion or increasing the number of candidates.`\r\n\r\n"],"correctAns":3},{"query":" Q65.
